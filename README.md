# SoftJS
One of my very first projects to learn 3D, a basic realtime cpu renderer with a very incomplete .obj loader ( which can only load the basic cube succesfully ).
Not that the renderer itself is complete haha, but it was a fun journey of endless debugging why my projection matrix was always weird.
